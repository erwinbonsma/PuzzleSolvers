# Tabula Cube

This is a solver for Yavuz Demirhan's [Tabula Cube][TC].
A cube puzzle consisting of 3x3x3 cubes, connected by planks.
It's a beautiful but tricky puzzle.
There are two parts to solving the puzzle.

First, determine how the pieces can fit together to form a cube.
This is tricky as each piece can be oriented in 24 different ways.
So there are a lot of combinations to try.
Deduction does not really help to reduce the search space to a manageable size.

Second, find out how to assemble the puzzle as the pieces interlock.
This is a challenge both intellectually as dexterity-wise.

This solver only solves the first part as that requires an exhausive search.
The second part you can solve yourself.
