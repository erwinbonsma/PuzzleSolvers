Repository with solvers for various (3D) construction puzzles.

Each solvers is (typically) specific to a particular puzzle. I am aware that there are generic
solvers such [BurrTools](http://burrtools.sourceforge.net). However, using that to solve puzzles
feels as cheating to me, whereas writing a custom solver doesn't :-).
